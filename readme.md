# What's this cookie

We strongly believe that privacy is a fundamental right. That's why we created this extension: to help you understand what's going on with your data.

## About data sources

All information on cookies is fetched from this open source repository: [open-cookie-database](https://github.com/jkwakman/Open-Cookie-Database). Feel free to contribute!

## About data permission & privacy

While this extension does need `tabs` and `cookies` Chrome permissions to work - which is a major security risk - it does not communicate in any way with any server outside of you computer. It also does not store any data on your web browser. It's 100% safe and private.

We will never ask for any permission that is not strictly necessary for the extension to work. If you have any doubt, feel free to check the source code yourself.
